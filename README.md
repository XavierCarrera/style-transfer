<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Deep Learning with Pytorch at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/deep-learning/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description: </h2>

For this project we use generative Cycle Gan networks to transfer styles from one image to another. This is done by applying convolutional neural networks, which allow us to apply different styles to them.
